3 ideas for project: 

<br><br>

1: A person moving from one end of the canvas to other end and repeat. 
<br>

Use concepts: Hierarchical models, joint rotation, GPU-based shaders, Ray tracing.

<br><br>

2: A car moving on the road. 

<br>

Use concepts: GPU-based shaders, Ray tracing, Shadows, Polygons: cube/sphere/cylinder/torus.

<br><br>

3. Different types of shape with textures on them floating around in canvas.

<br>

Use concepts: Matrices and linear transformations, Polygons: cube/sphere/cylinder/torus.
